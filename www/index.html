<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>
    Generic syntax highlighting support for Intelli/J IDEA. Uses simple configuration files to add syntax highlighting
    for eg Ruby, Python or any other file type.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast to writing a full-blown IDEA plugin for every language this plugin should have a new syntax available
    within minutes. In contrast to the XML filetypes extension that IDEA offers, this plugin is more flexible. (But of
    course less flexible than writing a full-blown language-specific IDEA plugin.. :)
</p>

<p>
    The basic concept is this: You write a SimpleSyntax configuration file specifiying a lexer configuration file plus
    the syntax elements and default coloring. In its simplest form the lexer configuration is based on simple regular
    expressions. This has obvious limitiations because of nesting etc.
</p>

<p>
    To allow for proper syntax highlighting, the SimpleSyntax plugin has been extended with more powerfull lexer
    configuration options:
</p>

<p>
    Since version 0.18 a JParsec based approach is used for the lexer configuration. The syntax is specified using a
    Groovy or JRuby script. The script creates a JParsec lexer which is then adapted to the IntelliJ lexer API.
</p>

<p>
    Since version 0.19 a JFlex based approach can be used for the lexer configuration. The syntax is specified using a
    Groovy or JRuby script. The script creates a JFlex lexer which is then adapted to the IntelliJ lexer API.
</p>

<p>
    Please see the example configurations in the 'SimpleSyntax/config' folder. You may want to check out the current
    state of things in the repository:
    <a href="http://idea-simsyn.tigris.org/source/browse/idea-simsyn/trunk/config/">trunk/config</a>
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
    After installing the plugin via the IDEA plugin manager, the Tools menu contains two new menu entries. Use
    'Init SimpleSyntax' to activate the plugin. This will install some default configuration files and make the
    syntax highlighting available for all configured file types. (Right now this should enable Ruby highlighting
    unless you have the JetBrains Ruby plugins installed. It should also activate highlighting for SimpleSyntax
    .config files.
</p>

<p>
    The configuration files used by the plugin are stored in IDEA's 'config/options' folder. For Windows systems this
    would be something like 'C:\Documents and Settings\Daniel\.IntelliJIdea60\config\options\SimpleSyntax'. There you
    can change the existing Ruby configuration or add new configurations for Python, ActionScript, or whatever.. :)
</p>

<p>
    After changing the configuration files, use the 'Reload SimpleSyntax' entry in the Tools menu to reload the
    configuration files and make your changes available.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately since version 0.20 of the plugin it is no longer possible to configure the color settings of the
    highlighting from within the IDEA 'Colors & Fonts' editor. Because of the dynamic way SimpleSyntax handles the
    configured languages, it would break IDEA. Therefore you have to go back to the configuration files and edit
    and reload them.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
    Please have a look at the IntelliJ IDEA related entries in my blog:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.berlinfactor.com/blog/?p=11">IDEA and Ruby</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.berlinfactor.com/blog/?p=12">IDEA Plugin Development</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.berlinfactor.com/blog/?p=13">IDEA (Not a) Rant Part 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.berlinfactor.com/blog/?p=14">Update: IDEA Plugin Development</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    This should explain the rationale of this project quite nicely: Even though I'm quite happy with IDEA overall, I
    think it has become too bloated and complex. With this plugin I'm trying to bring back some sanity.. :)
</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<ul>
    <li>This plugin is usable, but in an beta stage.</li>
    <li>Performance is acceptable for source code sizes up to a few thousand LOC.</li>
    <li>No proper plugin UI is provided. Configuration is based on editing text files in the plugin folder.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>
    Please don't hesistate to contact me in case of problems with the use and/or configuration of the plugin.
    Email me at simplesyntax [AT] intensicode [DOT] net. I'm also available as 136320506 on ICQ or thefrenchdj on AIM.
</p>

<h2>Download / Availability</h2>

<p>
    The plugin is available through the IDEA Plugin Manager.
</p>

<h2>Example Configurations</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="examples/SimpleSyntax.html">SimpleSyntax</a> - Groovy/JFlex based configuration for SimpleSyntax .config files</li>
    <li><a href="examples/JParsecRuby.html">JParsec and Ruby</a> - Groovy/JFlex based configuration for SimpleSyntax .config files</li>
</ul>

<h2>Road Map</h2>

<p>
    Unfortunately my job keeps me too busy right now to make any promises about dates. But these are the things I have
    planned for SimpleSyntax:
</p>

<h3>Milestone 1: Testing [COMPLETED]</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Implement the basic idea of a simple highlighter.</li>
    <li>Make init/reload more polite: Ask before overwriting files and/or overriding filetypes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Milestone 2: Flexibility [COMPLETED]</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Switch to more flexible lexer configuration.</li>
    <li>Use Groovy and/or JRuby to build syntax configuration based on JParsec.</li>
    <li>Add more configuration presets (Property files, etc).</li>
    <li>Investigate JFlex-based approach for maximum performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Milestone 3: GUI</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Add simple plugin configuration UI.</li>
    <li>Make it possible to turn available configurations on and off.</li>
    <li>Add config downloading (from plugin home - which is here, I guess).</li>
</ul>
